********************************
2.0.0 release notes (unreleased)
********************************

*Date in 2023*

Welcome to django CMS versioning 2.0.0!

These release notes cover the new features, as well as some backwards
incompatible changes youâ€™ll want to be aware of when upgrading from
django CMS versioning 1.x.


Django and Python compatibility
===============================

django CMS supports **Django 3.2, 4.0, and 4.1**. We highly recommend and only
support the latest release of each series.

It supports **Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11**. As for Django we highly recommend and only
support the latest release of each series.

Features
========

Status indicators in page tree
------------------------------

* Status indicators are shown in the page tree as of django CMS 4.1+
* For a more consistent user experience djangocms-versioning uses icons
  provided by django CMS 4.1+ and does not provide its own icons any more.
* If ``djangocms_admin_style`` is listed in the ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting
  make sure that at least version 3.2.1 is installed. Older versions contain
  a bug that interferes with djangocms-versioning's icons.

Status indicators for custom versioned models
---------------------------------------------

* The new ``StateIndicatorMixin`` allows to add state indicators to a grouper or
  content model's admin changelist view.

* The new ``ExtendedIndicatorVersionAdminMixin`` combines the
  ``ExtendedVersionAdminMixin`` and the ``StateIndicatorMixin``, where the
  version state is replaced by the indicator and the versioning actions are
  part of the indicator drop down menu.

Deletion protection
-------------------

By default ``Version`` objects which are sources for later versions are
protected from deletion. This implies that neither the corresponding content
object nor the grouper object can be deleted. To allow deletion of ``Version``
objects set ``DJANGOCMS_VERSIONING_ALLOW_DELETING_VERSIONS`` to ``True`` in
the project's ``settings.py``.


Backwards incompatible changes in 2.0.0
=======================================

Monkey patching
---------------

* Version 2.0.0 uses new configuration possibilities of django CMS 4.1+ and
  therefor is incompatible with versions 4.0.x
* As a result monkey patching has been removed from djangocms-versioning and
  is discouraged

Title Extension
---------------

As of django CMS 4.1 ``TitleExtension`` in ``cms.extensions.models`` has been
renamed to ``PageContentExtension`` to keep a consistent language in the page
models. This change is reflected in djangocms-versioning 2.0.0.

See this `PR <https://github.com/django-cms/djangocms-versioning/pull/291>`_.

Icon use
--------

Djangocms-versioning now uses icons from the core which are only available as
of django CMS v4.1+.


Miscellaneous
=============

* Adds compatibility for User models with no username field (see this
  `PR <https://github.com/django-cms/djangocms-versioning/pull/293>`_):
  Adds the possibility to configure which field of the User model uniquely
  identifies the User. Default is username.

Bug fixes
=========

* Adjust migrations to ensure MySql compatibility (see this
  `PR <https://github.com/django-cms/djangocms-versioning/pull/287>`_)
