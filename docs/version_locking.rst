Locking versions
**************************

Explanation
-----------
The lock versions setting is intended to modify the way djangocms-versioning works in the following way:

 - A version is **locked to its author** when a draft is created.
 - The lock prevents editing of the draft by anyone other than the author.
 - That version becomes automatically unlocked again once it is published.
 - Locks can be removed by a user with the correct permission (``delete_versionlock``)
 - Unlocking an item sends an email notification to the author to which it was locked.
 - Manually unlocking a version does not lock it to the unlocking user, nor does it change the author.
 - The Version admin view for each versioned content-type shows lock icons and offers unlock actions

Activation

    DJANGOCMS_VERSIONING_LOCK_VERSIONS = True
