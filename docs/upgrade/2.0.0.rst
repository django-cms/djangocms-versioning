2.0.0 release notes (unreleased)
********************************

*Date in 2023*

Welcome to django CMS versioning 2.0.0!

These release notes cover the new features, as well as some backwards
incompatible changes youâ€™ll want to be aware of when upgrading from
django CMS versioning 1.x.


Django and Python compatibility
===============================

django CMS supports **Django 3.2, 4.0, and 4.1**. We highly recommend and only
support the latest release of each series.

It supports **Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11**. As for Django we highly recommend and only
support the latest release of each series.

Backwards incompatible changes in 2.0.0
=======================================

Monkey patching
---------------

* Version 2.0.0 uses new configuration possibilities of django CMS 4.1+ and
  therefor is incompatible with versions 4.0.x
* As a result monkey patching has been removed from djangocms-versioning and
  is discouraged

Status indicators in page tree
------------------------------

* Status indicators are shown in the page tree as of django CMS 4.1+
* For a more consistent user experience djangocms-versioning uses icons
  provided by django CMS 4.1+ and does not provide its own icons any more.
* If ``djangocms_admin_style`` is listed in the ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting
  make sure that at least version 3.2.1 is installed. Older versions contain
  a bug that interferes with djangocms-versioning's icons.
